# Industrial-Copper-Modeling-Project
## *The approach of this project will allow the copper industry to leverage machine learning algorithms to make more accurate predictions, optimize pricing decisions, and improve lead classification.*


## Problem Statement:

**The copper industry faces challenges in dealing with less complex data related to sales and pricing, which can suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, and in capturing leads. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that involves building machine learning regression and classification models that leverage advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.**

## Approach: 

## The proposed solution will consist of the following steps:

**Data Understanding: Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical) and their distributions.**

**Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, treat outliers, and skewness. Encode categorical variables.**

**EDA: Visualize outliers and skewness (before and after treating skewness) using Seabornâ€™s boxplot, distplot, and violinplot. Use a heatmap to identify highly correlated columns and drop them.**

**Feature Engineering: Engineer new features if applicable, such as aggregating or transforming existing features to create more informative representations of the data.**

**Model Building and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets. Train and evaluate different regression and classification models & Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing model.**
